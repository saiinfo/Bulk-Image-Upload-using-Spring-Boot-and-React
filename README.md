# Bulk Image Upload using Spring Boot and React

This project demonstrates how to implement bulk image upload using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. Users can select and upload multiple images at once, and the images will be processed and stored on the server.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (for React frontend)
- Java JDK (for Spring Boot backend)
- IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA)
- Mysql (or any preferred database)

## Backend (Spring Boot)


1. Open the `backend` folder in your IDE.
2. Configure the MongoDB connection in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
3. Run the Spring Boot application.

## Frontend (React)

1. Open the `frontend` folder in your IDE.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure the API endpoint in `src/api.js`.
4. Run the React application: `npm start`

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the React frontend.
2. Choose multiple images using the file input.
3. Click the "Upload" button to send the images to the server.
4. The images will be processed and stored on the server.
5. You can view the uploaded images and their details on the frontend.
